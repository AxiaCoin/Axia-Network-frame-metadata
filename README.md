# frame-metadata

Defines FRAME metadata types for [Axlib](https://github.com/axia-tech/axlib) runtimes.

Originally part of the `axlib` repository, it was extracted here as part of https://github.com/axia-tech/axlib/pull/8615.

## Versioning
Starting from `v8`, all historical metadata type definitions are retained. These can be enabled via features e.g. `v13`. The latest version is enabled by default. All legacy versions are available under the `legacy` feature.

### Tooling
The intention is to provide tooling here in the future to handle the different versions of metadata.
